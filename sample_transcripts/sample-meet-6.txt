Text:   So hello, all. My name is Krish, and welcome to my YouTube channel. Today we have with us Tavishy.
And probably after many days, I'm making this kind of transition stories, videos, specifically with
people who have made transitions. So Tavishy, welcome. Definitely, there'll be a lot of things to
have a discussion in this podcast. But first of all, congratulations. You've made some terrific
transition. We'll understand about that entire story. Before we go ahead, first of all, how are you
feeling right now?

start-30.964 -> end-49.206 
Text:   I am actually, I'm at the seventh heaven. And because the reason is I'm having so many jobs in my
hand in this recession time period. So obviously I must be feeling so, so, so good. People are
looking for even one job and I have so many jobs in my hand.

start-49.94 -> end-74.104 
Text:   Okay, perfect. So Tavishy, before we go ahead, just give a brief intro about yourself, like what
your education background is and why data science for the first time, like first instance. Okay. So
hello, everyone. My name is Tavishy. I'm from New Delhi, India. I've done B.Tech in computer science
in 2014. But I was not able to

start-74.923 -> end-98.37 
Text:   joined as a software engineer or any other department because I wanted to become a fighter pilot.
So that time I tried for that, but because of the medical reasons, I was not able to make it
possible. So in 2015, I got an opportunity, like there was a mass hiring, I will not say, I will not
lie, there was a mass hiring going on in Snapdeal. So I joined Snapdeal as an onboard specialist.

start-98.37 -> end-117.978 
Text:   because I was not a fresher and there was a gap of 8-9 months, so I was not able to join any
company as a software engineer. I tried also, but I could not make it possible. And there was a fear
also that my sub-friends have already joined. There are very less options for me.

start-117.978 -> end-143.114 
Text:   then later on when I was working over there then I realized like I am not meant for this thing like
onboard specialist they are just calling and they are asking people okay can you give us the details
and all so this was not me so that time I was working on the MySQL also so that time I I've made up
my mind why not to change the field so in 2015 November I got a chance in

start-143.114 -> end-162.09 
Text:   polygon fabrics to join as an analyst, data analyst. So there, like, my career has been started. So
later on, when I was working there, my job was, like, my work was stagnant over there, my growth was
stagnant over there. So that time, like, it was like, data science was not

start-162.09 -> end-185.896 
Text:   at peak, people were just, normally there were only one or two videos were coming over there or one
or two news were coming over there. They just say aaj, har din if you are just going on internet.
Okay, now there is this transition in data science, new things are coming. So bahut saari cheeze us
time nahin thi, so I started. So luckily in my company,

start-186.442 -> end-210.06 
Text:   they were actually going into this data science field. They were hiring people for that. So that
time I, like, I hardly worked for two, three months on machine learning things. So I made inside
transition and later on, like, yeah. So later on, when I was working over there, obviously I was
facing difficulties and all, but I was,

start-210.06 -> end-240.06 
Text:   like still may handle by the cheese is still I can do that. But later on, when I was going forward,
then the point came like, okay, I'm good with machine learning, then why not to go to the other
other field, like I want to be a part of the computer vision or any other thing. But when I was
giving interview that time, I was actually facing difficulty because just working on normally
machine learning algorithms and answering the question to the intro is totally different thing.

start-240.06 -> end-270.06 
Text:   Because this is the first step, data processing is the first step, scikit-learn library is there to
help you. Okay, this is the first step, then go for the second step, third step and fourth step. So
that's totally different thing or answering questions is totally a different thing. So that time I
was facing difficulties. So I have joined iLearn also for the same. And there I got to know that
when you were discussing about your channel, okay, just go and watch videos over there. Then I
started watching your videos.

start-270.06 -> end-292.841 
Text:   for every single thing. Even for a small thing, I always search. This is my day-to-day part. Okay.
I just want to search for this gradient boosting Krishnayak video. Deep learning, any topic,
Krishnayak videos. Because of you, Krishnayak, I have made good transition and, yes, I'm able to

start-293.097 -> end-306.288 
Text:   You're really modest, obviously. It's really your hard work, you know. So we can only guide you, we
can only teach you. But at the end of the day, it's all your hard work. So definitely take the
credit for yourself. Just don't keep it for me.

start-306.664 -> end-325.35 
Text:   Let's go with the next question. So what do you think, like, how was your preparation strategy? You
know, every time probably you felt some kind of difficulty. This will definitely help people right
now who are preparing for data science. So what do you think, like, how was your preparation
strategy? Like, when you faced any difficulty, how did you solve that?

start-326.22 -> end-354.343 
Text:   Okay, first of all, when I was learning things, so I was not able to follow one path, because in
data science, there are so many things, so many things. And to lined up things is a basic. Because
nowadays, if new things are coming, and if you're not good with your basics, then you will not be
able to reach at heights. This is for sure. So

start-355.111 -> end-382.261 
Text:   I actually gave my most of the time to clear my basic parts. So for that, you need to start from
very basic, very, very, very basic, like Python ka pehla topic, what is string, statistics ka, what
is statistics, then, then go forward. Okay, what are the other types of like different types of
statistics? Why, why inferential statistics we are using, why descriptive statistics?

start-382.261 -> end-407.722 
Text:   we are using. So I took actually step by step. Before that, I was just jumping. Okay, today in
machine learning, we have to do another algorithm. Today in deep learning, we have to do object
detection. But before that, I was not even aware about the classification. So these kinds of
mistakes I have made. Then later on, I actually made a strategy. Okay, I will show you something. I
have a notebook like this.

start-408.439 -> end-432.927 
Text:   So actually, this was suggested by one of my friends. Why you are just writing in a, like, okay, I
will show you these things. Because sometimes it happens, like you have, you already have a study
material, but you want to write something. So that's why I took, like, I chose these kinds of
strategies. So I have these four or five notebooks with me.

start-433.865 -> end-453.285 
Text:   Okay, this you can call it as your holy Bible, you know. Holy Bible. When I actually I was using
register before that like pages normal. So that time what I like what I faced when I was reading new
things or when I was revising things so new things are coming up.

start-453.285 -> end-472.688 
Text:   And what I feel is that if you watch a video from somewhere and you understand that thing and
somebody is giving you a very good explanation over there, always get a printout. Always, always get
a printout and put that company in the notebook. Because when we revise it again,

start-472.688 -> end-501.749 
Text:   So you will figure out that yes, I know this. Now, Krishnayak, I have seen your videos so many
times that I can tell you where it is, where it is not, what you have said, what example you have
given. I will definitely tell you everyone about this. Krishnayak has said in an SPM video that in
an Amazon interview, he asked the question, what is the significance of C and eta we are using?

start-501.749 -> end-522.585 
Text:   Same question was asked to me in Datamatic. And the interviewer was impressed, like I knew this
thing. So you have done so many small things in your videos, there is no need to see anything else.
There is no need to see anything from anywhere. And I'm not promoting you right now. I'm just
telling you my experience.

start-522.944 -> end-544.497 
Text:   Thank you, Tavishy. Thank you. Tavishy, how was your interview process? Probably tell in a little
bit detailed manner so that people will be able to understand how many rounds you had, in the first
round, what did you ask, in the second round, what did you ask. I hope you also tell us how many
offers you currently have. Tell us if you're comfortable with that.

start-545.026 -> end-555.845 
Text:   I have more than six, seven offers right now. And yeah. In the first round of the interview, I was
mostly given the assignment.

start-556.51 -> end-580.572 
Text:   like they are giving me the random assignments, they are giving their data and they are saying,
make a machine learning model, come up with the idea, come up with the end to end project. So they
gave me only two days of time. And in those two days, why companies are actually approaching this?
Because if you are already experienced and if you are just going, okay, if you are a fresher also,
then you must be having idea about

start-580.572 -> end-591.442 
Text:   You cannot make fool to companies. So they are just testing you.

start-591.937 -> end-614.633 
Text:   Then later on, they mostly talk about what you have done in your assignment, what projects you have
done, what strategies you have made. And like in machine learning, people mostly asking about, okay,
why if there is an imbalance data, then how you will handle that? Why there is a

start-614.633 -> end-629.667 
Text:   like what is the possibility of leakage of a data? How you will find out why there is a leakage of
a data and there is an overfitting? How will you distinguish between these two things? So these type
of questions

start-629.667 -> end-659.172 
Text:   Why logistic regression is logistic regression? Why we are not calling it logistic classification?
Why in linear regression, we have three metrics or four metrics, MAE, MSE, RMSE? In class, I have
explained everything, I guess. You have explained every single thing. Why decision tree? Why
decision tree is not performing well? Why always overfitting?

start-659.172 -> end-666.408 
Text:   OK, one more strategy I would like to tell you if you want to do machine learning algorithms one by
one.

start-667.244 -> end-692.875 
Text:   First of all, if your base is good with linear regression, then I'm telling you, you won't have any
problem with any algorithm. Second thing, before going to the second algorithm, always, always look,
why, why, why this algorithm? If we have invented the previous algorithm, then why did we need this
algorithm? What was the drawbacks over there? So if you will go with this strategy, why didn't you
do that there?

start-693.148 -> end-707.022 
Text:   Quality is there for linear regression. So why more decision tree? Why K&N? So if you move forward
with this approach, then definitely you will make it possible. At the end, you won't have any
question that you can't answer.

start-708.302 -> end-724.514 
Text:   Very nice. So motivating, right? And you're right, right? If you probably anybody who follows this
strategy, where they focus on understanding why and probably at the end of the day, know how to
implement end to end, I think that would be more than sufficient to clear any interview. I hope I'm
right, right?

start-724.753 -> end-749.889 
Text:   Yes, and end-to-end. There is a playlist of seven. You started for the seven days. Believe me,
guys, if you want to just learn end-to-end, just watch that. Be patient. Be patient. When I started
with the transformer, Sudhanshu explained.

start-749.889 -> end-774.036 
Text:   Then I was like, I don't want to do it. When I picked it up again, I already knew 20% because I
already understood what you said. So when I watched the video 3-4 times, I can explain you even
right now how the transformer works. So never give up, never give up, never give up. If you don't
understand it once, watch it twice, watch it three times, watch it four times, watch it five times,
it will be done. It will be 100% done.

start-774.241 -> end-785.128 
Text:   Great, great, great. What was the maximum hike that you got from one company? Any of the companies?
Maximum hike.

start-785.213 -> end-804.923 
Text:   Maximize like, I'm getting like 170, more than 170% also. And one like normal hike is 72 to 80%
normal hike is 72 to 80%. That is the standard, I guess more than 50% in data science industry,
you'll be easily be able to get it. 170 is freaking big.

start-804.923 -> end-827.841 
Text:   I have offers, then why not to check my caliber, where I'm standing, what I can do. And if I'm
lacking somewhere, then what are the required things? So that's why I'm also giving more interviews
now. So I'm about to join within two days. But yeah, still I was giving interviews even after
getting the

start-827.841 -> end-845.128 
Text:   I think you have finalized the company, right? Yes, I have finalized the company. Who do you like
to name the company? Johnson's control India. So I'm joining software engineer data scientist over
there. Very nice.

start-845.606 -> end-873.951 
Text:   And let's talk about, you know, what do you think was, like, probably just talk about a timeline,
you know, when you were ready to give the interview. So how much time did you specifically take,
probably after working so much hard? Because after seeing your notes and things, I can say that you
have spent a good amount of time. So what was the timeline that you can probably take? And for any
other people, if they really want to make a switch into data science, what do you think the timeline
is? Every day, how much hours they need to invest in this?

start-874.548 -> end-893.439 
Text:   If I talk about myself, I have studied for 13-14 hours. I have studied for 15-15 hours because
there is not one thing in data science that you have to learn. There are many things. But if you
want to take your time normally, then 6-7 months.

start-893.66 -> end-915.162 
Text:   like for learning complete end-to-end models. And consistency is very much important. If you are
just reading today and you are taking a gap of four or five days, it will not work. It will not
work. You will have to work hard again. You will have to go back to the videos and see what was in
the video. You will have to recall it again.

start-915.162 -> end-942.09 
Text:   And I started applying for jobs in February. Actively, I was looking for a job. So this time, there
was a recession, so I got a premium job at Naukri.com. So what was my mistake in that? I took this
resume building also. So I was not aware that my other services haven't started yet. So one month
ago, I wasn't getting any calls. I wasn't getting any calls because this time, there was a recession
time period. I took a premium, and then I started getting calls.

start-942.961 -> end-953.183 
Text:   Believe me, guys, you will get so many calls. If you get 15 calls, you will get 3 or 4 interviews.
Not more than that. And out of those 3 or 4, you...

start-953.507 -> end-979.906 
Text:   They will be able to clear the first step in one or two. They won't be able to do it in all. But
after clearing that step, the interview that has to be given, the actual thing that starts, what
have you read so far, what is basic, what is not, everything depends on it. And believe me, no one
asks you why you have used this code, why you haven't used the other code. They will just ask about
your basic concept. Just basic concept.

start-979.906 -> end-1001.51 
Text:   What is standardization? What is normalization? In what cases we are using standardization and in
what we are using normalization? What is central limit theorem? Give a normal example of the day-to-
day life example of the central limit theorem. So these small, small questions they asked.

start-1001.51 -> end-1026.442 
Text:   There is nothing big. We just have to go step by step. If we go from A to B, then that is better.
Rather than A, then we are going to B, then we are again coming back to C. So if you do this, then
it won't be possible. It will take a lot of time. It will be possible, but it will take a lot of
time. Whatever topic you are talking about, right? I have made all the videos about all those
things. It's actually an interesting video.

start-1026.852 -> end-1053.609 
Text:   Every topic, like you said, standardization, normalization, why do we use it? I teach it like this
in class too. Very nice. The technique of teaching is following for the interview standards. It's
going very well. Like I told you, I joined iNeuron also in that one. I know the date also. On the
16th of April, you started the statistics playlist and there are four videos of that. If anyone has
seen those videos normally.

start-1053.609 -> end-1072.79 
Text:   Normally, because you have done so many examples like p-test, z-test, t-test. No one will fail. No
one will fail. No matter what kind of question comes up, it will solve it 100%. So you did FHDS
November 21 batch, right?

start-1073.268 -> end-1091.135 
Text:   I remember that. I have all the notes kept with me. So I usually keep all the notes that are
available.

start-1091.135 -> end-1115.486 
Text:   Now, what do you want to say to the rest of the people? In short, if you are preparing, what
happens to some people is that you have worked hard, right? You also know that sometimes you feel
like giving up. I need to give up now. This is more than enough. Sometimes I don't understand. When
there are no calls, many people get frustrated. So what advice should they give with respect to
preparation?

start-1115.486 -> end-1144.531 
Text:   with respect to keeping that particular mental state going on. Sometimes, like you are saying, if
you skip it for one or two days, then there will be a problem that you have to put in more effort.
Such scenarios come with a lot of people. So what advice would you like to give them with respect to
preparation? I will say only one thing. If you are not able to give more time for something, the
first thing is keep notes. Keep notes of each and every single thing.

start-1145.111 -> end-1164.599 
Text:   Every single thing you can understand because there are thousands of videos available. And what you
can understand from which video, what you can click, that depends on the person. Take notes of that,
read that and after finishing every topic, always search for questions.

start-1165.23 -> end-1182.108 
Text:   Questions on this topic, statistics, you will get three, four websites, good websites where you can
get more than 100 questions, 75 questions. Add that to your notebook. There will be a point, like
the first interview I gave, I asked for a date that I need one week.

start-1182.534 -> end-1197.5 
Text:   Because I had to revise everything. I had to revise everything that I didn't want to leave
anything. So that time it took me a week to revise everything. Then later on my time started to
reduce. Like four days, three days, two days, one day.

start-1198.609 -> end-1214.94 
Text:   Do not lose hope that if it doesn't happen in this, it won't happen in the next. If it doesn't
happen in this, it won't happen in the next. Do not think that this moment has come with me too. I
actually cried in front of my husband that I can't do it, I can't do it, this is it, that is it. So
don't be affected by these things.

start-1216.852 -> end-1241.425 
Text:   Keep reading, keep learning new things, keep learning new things, simple. If all these things are
there, then definitely one day you will crack that. One day it will come that you are cracking all
the interviews. All the interviews. Just like yours right now. Yes. Krish, you won't believe, at one
time I was actually in a depression that I am not able to crack even one interview. I am not able to
crack even one single interview. Where am I lacking? Where am I lacking?

start-1241.425 -> end-1262.346 
Text:   Since then, I have been using these strategies. Since then, I have been using these strategies.
Since then, I have been using these strategies. Since then, I have been using these strategies.

start-1262.346 -> end-1283.985 
Text:   This is the question and it's not in my notebook. I know I've read it, it's always there. Just make
a strategy, make a notebook, read again and again, read again and again, do not give up, call for
more interviews and follow back. If a company is calling you, because it's calling a lot of people.
They don't care if you're not responding, they'll call you back.

start-1283.985 -> end-1306.544 
Text:   So you call them again and again. What is the next process? Mail them. This is how you will
definitely get a job. This is what my strategy was and this is how I made it possible. I was just
running behind the company that you took my assignment. You didn't call me back. This is not the
right way. I was working also and I completed your assignment.

start-1306.544 -> end-1314.821 
Text:   Then they were in a guilt. They called me again. They interviewed me. Everything happened. And it
happened. If I hadn't called, my first interview wouldn't have cracked.

start-1315.538 -> end-1339.445 
Text:   Very nice, very nice. So, Tavishy, that's true. So amazing. Again, congratulations. I'm really
feeling proud, you know, when I hear this kind of transient stories. And obviously, after putting a
lot of effort, it really makes me feel that, okay, I need to prepare more better, probably to teach
you all, so that if there are some serious candidates, right, they definitely will be able to clear
it.

start-1339.445 -> end-1354.906 
Text:   Many people cannot afford very heavy amount of courses. So you are doing too good even with iNuron
also. And you are just charging 20,000 or like if you have a discount coupon also very less.

start-1354.906 -> end-1380.794 
Text:   And you are giving three, three, four, four hours of session. My God, this is too good. Salute to
you for this. And keep working like this. You're just two years older than me, but still you're a
guru for me because you're just giving me the right direction. Okay. What next? What next? What
next? You're like, whenever your videos come, I've always watched that. And please work hard like
this and please motivate us and please keep updated. Like an update.

start-1381.049 -> end-1403.865 
Text:   Definitely. Updating part, don't worry. Anything new will be coming. I'll be sharing those kind of
information with you all. So Tavishy, thank you once again. So guys, I will be providing Tavishy's
LinkedIn ID. I hope I can provide you information if someone wants to probably communicate, ask you
regarding your preparation strategy. Is that fine? We can put your LinkedIn ID in the description.
But at the end of the day, see,

start-1404.497 -> end-1428.046 
Text:   Like how I have guided you, you can guide someone, you know, who cannot probably invest so much.
Oh, you already started. I am bluntly saying that if you want to do something, then follow
Krishnaik. Blindly follow Krishnaik. Don't go here and there. Okay, I always encourage people that
if you understand in Hindi, don't feel like, no, this is in Hindi, how can I see? Don't feel it like
this. At the end, you have to get a job.

start-1428.046 -> end-1456.459 
Text:   And at the end, we have to give an interview in English. So there are English videos also. Because
there are some times we are all Indians. We don't understand things from the start that, OK, if all
this is not understood in English, then Hindi videos are already there. You are working double,
double hard. And people are getting a lot of benefit from that. When I saw your Hindi playlist of
machine learning, all my doubts were cleared. All my doubts were cleared. And yes, I can say that I
can correct any machine learning, any machine learning interview.

start-1457.176 -> end-1478.2 
Text:   That is so kind of you, ma'am. Great. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. So guys, this was it. I really
wanted to keep it till 20 to 24 minutes. But again, anything, any queries that you specifically
have, if you have any doubts, definitely contact Tavishan ma'am through LinkedIn. You will get all
the guidance specifically. So thank you, Tavishan ma'am, for coming to this specific podcast,
guiding all the students.

start-1478.2 -> end-1489.565 
Text:   Really, really happy for you. I hope you do really well and always we are there anytime, any kind
of queries, anything as such, any help in the future also will be there to help you out.

start-1489.923 -> end-1510.384 
Text:   Please make videos on LLM. We are eagerly waiting for your videos. I know it is very hectic to make
videos, but please try to do that. I'm trying my level best, whatever is possible from my side.
Definitely, I will be doing that, you know, till the end, whatever my life is till that end, I will
keep on.

start-1510.384 -> end-1524.974 
Text:   promoting AI, you know, because I know the importance of it. And it can help many companies, many
people and all. Right. So thank you, Tavishan ma'am. This was it from our side, guys. I hope you
like this particular video. We'll all see you in the next video. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye.
