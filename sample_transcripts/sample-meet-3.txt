Text:   Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being here of kind. Good morning. Good morning. Hey, how are
you? I'm doing well. I heard that you went to vacation, so how was it? It was fantastic. Where did
you go? Paris. Wow, so generous. Okay, before we start, make sure that all of you have the meeting
of agenda. Yes, yes. Okay, let me check the power point. Our purpose of the meeting

start-32.5 -> end-58.387 
Text:   Today is to discuss about the new market because as you know our sales keep increasing everyday
from generally 2007 until October. So I think it will be good if we could expand our product. What
do you think about it? I think we should expand our market right into overseas so that we can get
more customers and make a lot of money. Okay.

start-58.695 -> end-78.319 
Text:   Wow, that's really nice. But if we expand our market to overseas, which countries should we export
to our products? From my opinion, we may export our products to some countries in Europe, France,
England, Italy or Germany, in other areas like Australia and Switzerland.

start-78.609 -> end-101.937 
Text:   That's really nice idea to import our product to us or European countries like UK because as we
know that Koreans are really crazy for modern time skin. But for Asian countries like China, Korea
or Japan, I don't think so because they want to have a white skin. If we export or expand our
market, then we won't get a lot of profits.

start-101.937 -> end-121.101 
Text:   Moreover, they strongly believe in their culture that they should have the white skin. It will
bring you good luck. We will move to the market again. As you know, our products only focus on 30 or
40 years old.

start-121.101 -> end-138.951 
Text:   Should we be looking for the new market target? Yeah, I think our old target market around 30 to 40
age is okay. However, we should focus more on younger age around 70 to 22 because the trend of
homescales is becoming more popular than before.

start-138.951 -> end-165.708 
Text:   and most of people always think that tone speed is very attractive to our people. Okay, I really
like your idea. Like, you focus on the old customers and looking for the new customers that way. But
I'm not sure that the young is like 70 to 20 years old. Do they have money to buy our product?
Because as you know, our product is quite luxury. So we should set a price.

start-165.759 -> end-189.787 
Text:   set our product in the mass market which we can set a price in different levels, low middle and
high prices. Moreover, to attract new middle, younger customer, we also should set a price to be
cheaper for those who are students and those who are workers that receives an average income all
over.

start-189.906 -> end-216.937 
Text:   To do so, I think we would get more profit at the growth of our company. Yes, I agree with you. But
I think that we should be a small size because some people they want to jump before buying a big
one. They don't want to waste a lot of money.

start-217.039 -> end-242.927 
Text:   That's really nice idea for most of you. We should be the next ambassador because our market is
expanding to international. So I would like to know who should be our brand ambassador. In my
opinion, I think Rihanna because she is a brown skin tone. She is very famous and has many fans. So
I think this is the best PR technique to make our product famous.

start-242.927 -> end-253.524 
Text:   Absolutely agree with you because she has a tan skin and she is very famous, therefore she has a
lot of fans and maybe her fans will be crazy about our product.

start-254.206 -> end-282.227 
Text:   For me, I suggest Taylor Swift because she is a famous singer and she can create a brand image for
our product. That's why I chose her to be a singer. Taylor Swift is also okay but the problem is we
are selling the sunscreen. So our bread and butter should have the sunscreen. So Taylor Swift quite
popular but she doesn't have ground skin to show our product, image of our product.

start-282.227 -> end-296.544 
Text:   For me, I choose Kylie Jenner. Since she is very well known among teenagers and has a lot of
followers on the internet, so I think her influence can draw the members to try our products.

start-296.852 -> end-319.002 
Text:   That's really nice point too, because Kelly Jenner is the idol of the young age, so we have two
persons in our mind. First is Kelly Jenner as Ithana. So we will talk about this in next week. Okay,
we come to the last part. Before that, will you tell me if we go beyond the 10 minutes? Okay.

start-320.333 -> end-327.654 
Text:   As we know, we will introduce our product to the new Monday, which promotes that it can grab our
customer attention.

start-328.507 -> end-354.838 
Text:   In my opinion, we just expand to the new target. So we should give a sample product to people who
buy our product. Moreover, giving 20% of income to people who buy more than 5,000 bucks. Okay, I
agree with you that we will give the sample of product as a small package, but I don't agree with
the 20% of discount because it will cost a lot of money to our company.

start-354.838 -> end-372.551 
Text:   Excuse me, I think we have to finish this topic soon as we have just 50 minutes before the meeting
ends. Okay, I would like to wish Morgana to sum up what we have said in this meeting to make clear
the understanding to all of us.

start-372.551 -> end-390.452 
Text:   So we have talked about supporting our product for new countries such as United States, England,
Germany and Australia. So as far for the target market, normally we focus on working-age but we try
to focus on the group of new-age exchanges.

start-390.452 -> end-418.746 
Text:   but now we will also change our premium products to mass product because mass product is easy for
us to target easily and we will get our price cheaper than before so the next ambassador for the new
market will be considered in the next meeting so finally our new promotion is that we will give
product example like virtual for customers okay do you have any questions? no thank you for today
see you and bye
